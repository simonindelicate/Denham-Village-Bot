the centre of the village, and the obvious place to start the village walk, is the church of St. Mary the Virgin. The existence of a church on this site dedicated to the Virgin almost certainly predates the Norman Conquest in 1066, though the tower we see today is Norman. The tower was constructed in the years following 1066 and attached to a rather less solid construction which was replaced in the early years of the 13th century. The tower has eight bells recast in 1683 from five larger bells brought from Biddlesden Abbey on the orders of Sir Robert Peckham following Henry VIII’s Reformation of the church and his dissolution of the monasteries."

the west of the church to be seen over the churchyard wall is Bowyer House, now a private residence but from 1721 until 1877 when state education took over it was the village’s “charity” school educating the children of the village’s farm labourer population.  A sign still to be seen on the wall of the house reads: ""In the year of Our Lord 1721, This Charity School was Erected by Subscription of ye Inhabitants of this Parish and Other well disposed Persons and is perpetually Endowed by Sir William Bowyer Bart, of Denham Court with Thirty Pounds Pr. Annum. Go and Do Likewise."" In front of Bowyer House fronting Village Road is Hills House. It is named for Sir Roger Hill, descendant of medieval knights, Member of Parliament for Bridport during the English Civil Wars of  the 17th century, Sheriff of Buckinghamshire in 1672/73 and a “fierce” supporter of the campaign to prevent the Catholic brother of Charles II from taking the throne. It was a campaign that initially failed as James did become King James II but he was ousted in 1688. Sir Roger purchased Denham Place in 1670, but lengthy litigation followed his purchase and it was not until 1679 that he actually took possession. He then set about a full reconstruction of the mansion and lived in Hills House until the reconstruction work at Denham Place was completed in 1701.

artists and stars - Next to Hills House is Fayrstede also once the home of a film producer, Stanley Long. It is also said that when Denham Village provided accommodation for film stars, directors and crew working at Sir Alexander Korda’s Denham film studios or at Pinewood, Fayrstede provided a secret bolthole away from the media for Marilyn Monroe whilst she was in England to film The Prince and the Showgirl.The name Fayrstede means, in old English, the place where the fayre is held and a fayre has been held in Denham since at least 1227, with a break from 1873 when it was thought to be attracting undesirables, until 1925. However it seems more likely that the centre of the old fair was a little further away on Cheapside and that Fayrstede actually acquired its name from that of a local landowning family of “de Fayrestede”. There are records of a house in the Village called Fayrstede as early as the 1320s when Thomas de Fayrstede was mentioned as owning lands in Denham.

house with the mysterious name - Set back from Village Road behind the wall is Wrango Hall, its name having recently reacquired its almost forgotten description as a “Hall”.  It is known that the land on which it stands once accommodated several cottages and was known as Wrango in the time of King Henry VIII in the 16th century but what the name actually means has defied research. English Heritage dates the recently, and magnificently, restored building to the 1700s, but there is a record of a wealthy tobacco merchant, William Newbury living on the site from 1637 to 1663. Subsequent owners included Colonel Sir Thomas de Veil (occupant from 1720 to 1737) who is credited with others as a creator of England’s police and justice system and William Sedgewicke, Captain of the East India Company trading ship “London”.

The Green Man is the beginning of what was from the late 19th to the mid 20th century  Denham Village’s own shopping centre. The bow fronted house used to be Sidney Williams’ grocery and general store and next door, across the lane once known as Brook Street with its tiny farmworkers’ cottages leading down to the river, was the greengrocer and, later, village coal merchant, Charles Hoffman. Part of Charles Hoffman’s house had once been yet another Denham beerhouse, The Black Donkey, but few records exist about that."

few paces on and today’s visitor is at the entrance to Da Remo’s Italian Restaurant where Remo Di Lellio and his colleagues wait to welcome visitors. Old village residents remember it as the Tudor Restaurant, later The Tudor Lounge, where the movie stars from the nearby London Film Studios came to enjoy lunch. After Remo took over and renamed the restaurant, he still provided a regular table for Sir John and Lady Mills. But long before the building became a centre of village hospitality, this building served both as the village tailors, and as its post office where in 1891 the 18 year old Ada Wiggins was ahead of the times offering villagers their own local telegraph services.

photographs show that in the earliest years of the 20th century The Swan and The Green Man welcomed their customers as much to “Teas” as to any other fare.

Evans kept the newsagents and sweet shop next to The Crocus. She was the granddaughter of Albert Wiggins, the village “cryer” and son of Edwin Wiggins who kept the post office.  The newsagents had been in Valerie’s family for nearly a century until she finally retired in the 1990s. The metal frame into which Valerie would stuff the daily papers for early commuters on their way to Denham station was still pinned to the wall of her cottage until very recently. Valerie’s shop stood next door to that of Sidney Stevens the butcher. Mr. Stevens was of a new breed of shopkeeper. He was not a local. His venture in Denham was a branch of his main business in Amersham, but no doubt still very welcome to the villagers venturing out to buy the Sunday roast. It’s worth pausing for a moment there to imagine Denham’s shopping high street bustling with local shoppers stopping to pass the time of day, in peacetime and in wartime, sharing news good and bad, welcoming visitors and steering them to the best of the places offering tea and cakes.  Perhaps you’d come across Mr. Horney wheeling his cart through the village laden with fruit and vegetables. And could Valerie Evans possibly have been right when she said that back in the early 1930s, she once saw the fascist leader Oswald Mosley, who lived up at Savay Farm, strolling along Village Road in the company of Adolf Hitler?

have reached what is now the Village Green, but before stopping there, look across to the gate that bears the name of Mr. A.F.Richins, Cherry Woodworkers Limited. Behind that gate worked the craftsmen and women who made fine furniture to equip the sets at the film studios – and many thousands of those little wooden spoons that came with jars of Colmans Mustard. Cottages and the Sheriff’s house - Then there is The Old Cottage dated, at least viewed from the outside, to the time of Queen Elizabeth I in the 16th century – externally the oldest cottage in the village. Pass Winton House, once named The White House, and come to the curiously named Walter the Abbott.

Cottage is where one of Britain’s greatest film directors and producers Sir David Lean relaxed tending the garden whilst he lived there with his wife, the actress Kay Walsh in the 1940s. Beyond Melgan Cottage at the corner of The Pyghtle is the oldest still standing building (excluding the church) in the village - at least on the inside as it was largely reconstructed externally in the 1950s. This is The Old Bakery part of which was indeed, as its name indicates, the village bakery. In much earlier times, this house, or a least the house then built around its ancient frame had a grander status. Nicholas de Lytlington was Abbot of Westminster from 1362 to 1386 and as abbot, he had of course use of all the lands in the Abbey’s ownership including Denham. Apparently Nicholas found Denham to be one his favourite hunting grounds. Though its official listing puts its construction at least a century later, other evidence suggests that the original construction of what we know as The Old Bakery took place in 1367 and so may well have been built on Nicholas’ orders.

manor house of some importance - Turn back then to the Village Green and the ornate gates which stand to the side of the green leading into the grand manor house, Denham Place. Though the green is of a substantial size it is hard to imagine that until the middle of the 20th century it accommodated five tenant cottages - and a mortuary. The green as we know it today is the result of a gift made in 1952 by Herbert Ward, brother of Lady Vansittart. It is now managed by a trust overseen by Denham Parish Council. The ornate gate at the side of the village green gives access to the manorial house and estate of Denham Place. The building visible through the gate is not the manor house. That stands in its own park some distance from the gate surrounded by high walls. A private residence, it offers no access to the public but at least walkers around the village can come close to the site of some remarkable historical events. Denham Place manor house as it is today was built on the orders of Sir Roger Hill between 1679 and 1702 and it remained in the ownership of Sir Roger’s descendants, the Way family, until 1920 – though they did not always occupy the house. For a brief period in the 1830s,  the brother of Napoleon Bonaparte leased Denham Place from Benjamin Way. The male heirs of the Way family held the title Lord of the Manor and Mr. John Way remains to this day the patron of St. Mary’s Church.

was however in 1585/86 that events at Denham Place made their most significant contribution to English history. The manor house then, not the one built by Sir Roger Hill, was home to Sir George Peckham, a committed Catholic at a time, during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, when there were deep divisions between Protestants and adherents to the Catholic faith. In the earlier years of Elizabeth’s reign, Sir George’s religion was no great obstacle to his friendship with the Queen.

those extremists determined to replace Elizabeth as queen with her cousin the Catholic Mary Queen of Scots were a Jesuit priest, Father John Gerard and a 24 year old member of the Catholic gentry, one Anthony Babington. A close associate of Babington was Sir George Peckham’s son, Edmund. Edmund was also brother in law to the Jesuit priest Gerard. Edmund Peckham certainly had dangerous friends. So it was that in 1585 and 1586, the Peckhams allowed Denham Place to be used as the venue for a series of false exorcisms designed to frighten the local population against Protestantism and instil the belief that only the true Catholic religion could provide protection against demonic possession. The darker purpose of Babington and his associates, perhaps also of Edmund Peckham who patronised the exorcist movement, was to set the scene for a Catholic uprising to follow Elizabeth’s assassination. Babington is known to have attended Denham Place at the time of the fake exorcisms.Edmund Peckham died early in July 1586 and was buried in St, Mary’s Church on 7th July.  That same day Anthony Babington wrote a fateful letter to Mary Queen of Scots informing her of the assassination plot. It was to lead ultimately to her execution by order of her cousin Elizabeth.  The Babington plot was foiled. Babington was barbarically executed on 20th September 1586. Mary Queen of Scots was executed on 8 February 1587. Queen Elizabeth foreclosed on a debt due from Sir George Peckham by confiscating Denham Place which she later sold to Sir William Bowyer of Denham Court. The record of the exorcisms which occurred at Denham Place were later used by William Shakespeare in his portrayal of the madness of Edgar in King Lear. "

Village Green - and Milchester ? Turn back then to the Village Green. Though the green is of a substantial size it is hard to imagine that until the middle of the 20th century it accommodated five tenant cottages - and a mortuary. The green as we know it today is the result of a gift made by Herbert Ward, Lady Vansittart’s brother, in 1952.

across the Village Green is The Falcon, also serving good food and offering welcome accommodation to overnight visitors to the village. Further towards the bridge over the Misbourne are Forge Cottage and Old Forge both now private residences but once, as their names suggests, the centre of an essential business in a farming community to forge tools and farming equipment. The petrol pump of the Archers’ garage at the Old Forge is long gone now, but the memory of stars from the studio filling their petrol tanks lingers. Across the bridge is another of Denham’s iconic properties, Misbourne Cottage dating from the late 16th century. It is named for the brook of the Misbourne river which runs around it. The village has been a location for many films and television dramas, including several Midsomer Murders. Certainly amongst the most fondly remembered are the four films of the 1960s based on Agatha Christie’s crime novels with Margaret Rutherford as Miss Marple.

Street and an old non-conformist chapel - Walk on for a while to reach the left turn into Cheapside Lane. Some villagers insist that the addition of “Lane” to its name is a modern invention, though the truth is that the census compilers of the 19th century could not themselves make up their minds whether to call it Cheapside Lane or just Cheapside. Without a doubt the addition of “Lane” is not historically necessary. “Side” alone would do since Cheap is derived from the Old English word “ceapan” meaning to buy and placed with “side” together they signify that this was the old market place. Walk up Cheapside then past the Village Hall and the old telephone exchange on the right until you reach the left turn into what is now Ashmead Lane. Then before turning into Ashmead Lane carry on a few paces up Cheapside to come upon the tiny old Methodist Chapel covered in ivy.  This was once one of several cottages occupied by the members of a small Methodist community, many of them the relatives of John House the wheelwright who ran his business in a yard behind the cottages. It was this John House who obtained a license under the Toleration Act of 1689 to use his house on Cheapside as a place of worship. The plaque on the outside of the chapel suggests that the chapel was in use first in 1820 a year or so after the house was built, but the record of the licence is dated 1828.   Two doors away from the chapel at the corner of Ashmead Lane by the side of the well now long gone, the small Methodist community had their own school, known as a British School established for the poor children of nonconformist communities to match the growing number of schools being established by the Church of England."

army ? Return then to Ashmead Lane, once known simply as Back Lane for an obvious reason and also as Love Lane for no less obvious reasons. Take a look at the fields to your left as you walk along Ashmead Lane. About them there is an unproven legend from the English Civil Wars of the 1640s. In 1644 representatives of King Charles I and representatives of the rebellious Parliament met at the Crown and Treaty Public House in Uxbridge in the hope of negotiating a treaty to end their disputes. They brought their armies with them in case a battle should break out. The King’s army was camped to the south of the town, the Parliamentary army to the north. Legend has it that it was on these fields that the Parliamentary army assembled to prepare for trouble. The two sides parted with only a tenuous agreement that soon collapsed, but at least there was no battle. As you reach Old Mill Road glance across slightly to your right at the four Blackbarn Cottages at the edge of the village conservation area.

go left down Old Mill Road. To your right is Priory Covert, its name recalling the times when small game seeking refuge from their hunters tried to hide in the undergrowth. At the bridge, on your right, is The Priory originally built as the village poor house in 1789 with a grant extracted from Sir William Bowyer of Denham Court to the great displeasure of Lady Bowyer who feared, with some justification it seems, the growing wrath of Sir William’s creditors. On the left is Mill House, now as a private residence much altered from the days as a mill making good use of the flow of the River Misbourne. You are now back on Village Road. Behind the wall to your right are the buildings of the old Court Farm now a gated community of private residences. Continue on past Holtye to the junction of of what was until the 1890s Church Road with its own cottages backing on to the churchyard of St. Mary’s. You are now at the point once regarded as the entrance to Denham Village. To your left is a wall itself protected by a heritage listing behind which stands Denham’s own White House with its extensive beautiful gardens opened annually as part of the National Garden Scheme to support charities. The White House was originally named, as a much smaller house, simply Denham Cottage. Then it became The Cedars and for a while “Brook” referencing the brook of the Misbourne which runs through the gardens. If it’s Sunday and in summer, tea and cakes may be on sale in the vestry.

the church and immediately visible to every passer-by is Denham’s memorial to its fallen. Sculpted by Denham’s own Francis Bacon from Portland Stone, the memorial was unveiled and dedicated on 5 October 1919. It carries the names of 42 fatal casualties of war, names still known amongst Denham residents including three members of the Tillard family whose name was taken for the Way and Tillard Recreation Ground and Cricket Pitch to the south of Ashmead Lane.. Cross to the gate on the west side of the church and take the path headed towards the vestry. It was this path that American novelist James Salter recalled as he wrote of his search for a memorial to his friend, Broadway theatre producer Ethel Linder Reiner sometime owner of Hills House. Passing other memorials he wrote: “Newer than these, destined to be less visited, was a marble plaque in the wall beside the cottage garage”.

past the north wall of the vestry to come upon the gravestone of the seven members of the Marshall family cruelly murdered in their Cheapside home on 22nd May 1870. Further along on the other side of the path can be found the family graves of the Patons including those of Denham’s much-loved village doctor Ian Paton and Madelene his wife. Behind them can be found the grave of Sir James Martin C.B.E Engineer, Inventor and joint founder of the Martin Baker Aircraft Company. Famously known for his invention of the life-saving aircraft seat, Sir James is rather less well known for his invention of the fish fryer. Close by is the obelisk marking the grave of the Reverend R.H. Lathbury, Rector of St. Mary’s and the most diligent chronicler of Denham’s history up to the turn of the 20th century. His remarkable “The History of Denham, Bucks”, just 100 copies of which were published in 1904, still provides much of the source material for research into the history of the village.  "

the grass lying flat is the large stone marking the graves of Terence Conyngham Plunket 6th Baron Plunket and his wife Dorothé both killed in a plane crash when on their way to visit William Randolph Hearst in California in 1938. Return to the path and head north again passing the graves of the Ways, owners of Denham Place and Denham’s leading family for nearly 200 years until 1920. On then past the 11 official war graves, memorials to men killed in the first and second world wars, Rifleman Tipping, Aircraftman Runcieman, RAF Sergeant Frank Martin and others all lost far too young. Carry on to find the grave of two of Denham’s most famous recent residents, Sir John and Lady Mills. Pause for a moment in front of the stone to remember this great man of British cinema, then turn through180 degrees and take a few paces east to come upon the memorial stone of Baroness Sidonie Nádherná von Borutín. Once known as Baroness the Beautiful, Sidonie was, between the two world wars, a famed Bohemian hostess of literary salons and correspondent with poets and writers. Impoverished first by the Nazi confiscation of her family home and subsequently by the Communist takeover of Czechoslovakia, Sidonie fled to Britain in the late 1940s dying tragically in 1950. She lay buried in St. Mary’s Churchyard until 1999 when her remains were returned to her former home at Janowitz castle and her fame was restored.

further then into the open field to wander amongst the graves of more recent residents, all of whom have made their contributions to the community in many different ways. Amongst these stones is also the grave of Lady Cynthia (“Cimmie”) Mosley, Labour Member of Parliament and first wife of Sir Oswald Mosley. Cimmie died tragically in 1933 as her husband continued his now infamous political journey from socialism to fascism. Her stone, now surrounded by the graves of those more recently lost, is modest. The inscription it bears has none of the strutting vanity of Sir Oswald’s later images. It reads simply “My Beloved. A little space was allowed her to show at least a heroic purpose and to attest a high design”. Now return along the path to the east side of the church.

then back towards the south wall of the church to find the grave of Sir Robert, First Baron, Vansittart. “Van”, as he was known, was a senior diplomat, prime ministerial adviser and one of the few people at the heart of government who fully recognised the threat posed by Hitler’s Nazis in the early 1930s. He was also second cousin to T.E.Lawrence (of Arabia) and a published poet, novelist and playwright. Close by the church wall behind the graves of the Mortens of Savay Farm can be found one of the churchyard’s most enigmatic stones. Now broken it lies flat, its inscription worn and moss covered. It marks the grave of Captain John Wing. At its head is the skull and bones, the reminder of mortality, which has led many to the belief that an infamous pirate rests here. There is evidence of the burial of a John Wing in Denham in 1742, but the date of this record does not match the stone.

Falcon stands on a site from which the villagers of Denham have for many centuries acquired sustenance though in early times a sustenance rather less stimulating than that now enjoyed. In the time of Henry VIII, who ascended the throne in 1509, the property was known as Emmots Deye, the dairy owned, or at least leased from the lord of the manor by one Mr. Emmot or Emmett. Its subsequent owner, one Richard Curtis, however saw the opportunity to turn the establishment from a dairy into a house serving fine ale and other fayre. Richard and his successors, Thomas Falx and John Maskel clearly prospered for when James Maskel took over from his father in 1573, he was required to pay taxes on his father's estate and it cost him further the equivalent of today's £500 (just £2 in 1573) just to enter the property. By 1623 the property had been acquired by Robert Bowyer, brother of Sir William Bowyer who in 1596 had purchased Denham Court and whose name is still familiar in Denham. Robert himself owned hundreds of acres of farmland in the area but it was Sir William who persuaded the College of Arms to acknowledge the Bowyers' ancient family armorial achievements.

1845 the Falcon was put up for auction, by then part of the Denham Place estate owned by the Way family. The advertisement promoting The Falcon Inn reads: “A convenient House, containing Parlour, Bar, Tap Room, Club Room, four Bed Rooms, Dressing Room, three Attics, Kitchen, and Cellars, with Yard, Out-buildings, Garden, and Meadow, and Stabling for Six Horses, facing it in the village”. The Falcon acquired a new proprietor in 1903. He was announced together with an indication of the fayre he offered: Proprietorship, The Falcon Inn, Denham Village, Bucks: Arthur Weaser, Wine and Spirit Merchant Agent for Wethered’s Marlow Beers Bottles, Jars, and Small Casks All orders will be Delivered and Punctually Attended to. Arthur Weaser was evidently a licensed victualler who considered himself a cut above the labouring classes. The word publican was clearly below the social station of which he claimed membership. It was never used by those actually ""in trade"".

childhood resident Stanley Hoffman wrote of his life in the early 20th century: “Many are the tales my mother would tell of her days and evenings behind the bar of the Falcon, when the men from the railway, the gangers and plate-layers, the labourers and the navvies, would pour down the Pyghtle and crowd into the Green Man, the Swan, and the Falcon in the village. Mr. Weaser was the keeper of the Falcon Hotel. His fourth child, Ellen Gertrude Weaser born in March 1888 was my mother.” It is Stanley Hoffman who also records: “There was much drunkenness and for a while my mother was not allowed to serve in the bars. But my grandfather (Arthur Weaser) was capable of dealing with any trouble or threatening incidents and his pub had a reputation as a good house.” The Falcon was often used for local auction sales of land, woods, livestock, farm equipment, as well as furniture and personal items. As a place frequented by the general public, a pub was a convenient place for patrons to discuss the terms and other particulars of the sale properties - and surely another opportunity to stop for a drink and enter into the discussions.

well as being in use as auction rooms The Falcon doubled as a courtroom for the holding of inquests and no doubt encouraged by Arthur Weaser's reputation, The Falcon was much used by social groups, clubs and societies - and indeed local political parties - for their meetings and events. Amongst these was the local branch of the Ancient Order of Foresters. The Foresters Friendly Society is a British charity formed in 1834 to help its members and others in need. In November 1908, as the local press reported, the Denham Foresters ""gathered in force at the Falcon Inn on Monday, when the anniversary of Court Golden Falcon, Ancient Order of Foresters (AOF) was celebrated by a first-class dinner and a rattling ‘smoker’ "". On that evening, Arthur Weaser catered to the more than “50 trenchermen in attendance who filled the club room, then cleared the dishes like the healthy Britishers they were.” In turn, they congratulated Mr. Weaser as “an old hand at catering, and he did so with dignity and confidence providing a “capital cold collation followed by a true English plum pudding.”"

pub also has a history of raising funds for charities. One particularly creative venture was, as the Uxbridge & West Drayton Gazette reported on 3 November 1939, the establishment of The Falcon Penny Club. The idea was suggested by ""an assistant of Mrs. F.E. Holgate (wife of the proprietor) who was appointed treasurer"". As an adhesive, beer was first-rate. The drinkers would dip a penny into beer, then while it was still wet, they would stick the pennies onto the glass of the nearest picture for collection later to “purchase comforts for local men on active service”. Noted amongst the members of the Penny Club was the actress Gertrude Musgrove, the wife of Vincent Korda and sister-in-law of Alexander Korda.  Miss Musgrove's claim to cinema fame included an appearance alongside Leslie Howard and her sister-in-law Merle Oberon in The Scarlet Pimpernel in 1934.There are however sadly no other records showing the success of The Falcon Penny Club – neither for fundraising nor for distribution of the funds to achieve its objectives In 2001The Falcon underwent a major refurbishment. The room accommodations had become dilapidated and unusable. The rooms are now AA Four Star Award Rooms. All en-suite rooms have upper story views, The Stanton, The Dickens, The Green, and The Garden provide accommodation with comfort for guests, breakfast included.The Garden at The Falcon has also been updated over the years. It is sometimes the venue for live music for diners and those relaxing with a drink.

the sign on the Swan here in Denham, has portrayed the White Buckinghamshire Swan with a coronet attached to a heavy gold chain around its neck. But in his book on The History of Denham published in 1904, the Rev. Robert Lathbury traces a royal history of the Swan symbol rather more narrowly confined to Denham. He includes a sketch which clearly shows the early symbol. Lathbury explains that ""The Swan, collared and chained is derived according to all genealogists from the family of the de Bohuns; Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Lancaster, afterwards [King] Henry IV having married Mary de Bohun, youngest daughter and co-heir of Humphrey ,Earl of Essex, Hereford and Northampton."" The Swan symbol is then traced back, through the earldom of Essex to Adam FitzSwannus a large estate owner in the north of England at the time of William the Conqueror. Robert Lathbury continues: “We have seen how in the early days of Denham, from A.D. 1258 to A.D. 1287, John de Bohun, and Johanna, his wife daughter of Bartholomew de Capella, ruled the affairs of the manor, and how other members of the de Bohun family had land also in Denham. This being so, how strongly this badge of the Swan, the emblem and the badge of the de Bohun family, takes us back to the days when they occupied these scenes; how the present is linked to the past, and old memories revived, which, it is hoped, this book will in some measure help to preserve.” Old photos show the sign, just as it is described, prominently attached to a bracket far enough above the door to swing in the wind. Look now and the swan is carved and not quite black – one side looking toward the pub; the other side looking away, perhaps to show the swan’s association with being a free, wild bird.

of the most illustrious and locally active landlords of The Swan in the late 19th and early 20th century was Mr. Lewis Bampton. The local press gave him a glowing obituary when he passed peacefully away at the ""advanced"" age of 84 years on 13th January 1908. ""By the death of Mr. Bampton, Denham loses one of its oldest inhabitants. He came to Denham over 41 years ago, from Hammersmith and took over the licence of the Swan Hotel, which he has held ever since. Mr. Bampton was one of the oldest licence holders in the county of Buckinghamshire. The deceased was well known and respected in the village, and always took the keenest interest in every kind of sport and friendly society. The cricket and football clubs found in him an ardent supporter, and even of late years when he had been unable to walk, he frequently desired to be wheeled in a bath-chair to see the cricket matches. Notwithstanding the sad loss of Lewis Bampton, pub and hotel services at the Swan continued without interruption. Mr. Bampton’s replacement was his son-in-law Robert Henry Taylor.

Taylor was much esteemed by all classes in Denham and by the many travellers and visitors to the old-world village who found Mr. Taylor a genial host. In addition to family and friends, mourners also represented The Falcon, the Green Man, and The Plough to show their respect to a fellow publican. Like The Falcon, The Swan too has been frequently the venue for meetings, in the case of The Swan perhaps of a more formal nature than those of The Falcon. In 1783 The Swan was identified as the venue for meetings of ""Friendly Societies"". These were bodies which long preceded the welfare state and which were established as ""mutual organisations” or benefit societies composed of a body of people who join together for a common financial or social purpose"".

Swan was also used as a courtroom for inquests and no doubt the most highly publicised inquest was that investigating the deaths of seven members of the Emmanuel Marshall family murdered on 22 May 1870 in their home on Cheapside Lane. In his book “The Denham Massacre: Nineteenth-Century Britain’s Most Shocking House of Horror Murders” Neil Watson sets the scene: “A strong body of police officers under Captain Drake maintained order within and around the building, holding back the large crowds and ensuring that only those with a valid reason should be admitted.” Frederick Charsley, from South Buckinghamshire was the coroner. Fourteen male jurors took the stand, but not before they were required to visit the Marshall house and view the bodies of the seven violently murdered family members. Neil Watson again: “The jury foreman was the Rev Charles Joyce; other jurors were from age 31 to 73 and likely represented the area inhabitants: millers, tailor, butcher, bakers, gardener, blacksmith, grooms and an agent of farm steward. At the next (second) hearing the jury would hear evidence from the doctors who had conducted the post mortem examinations”. When all of the evidence had been submitted and reviewed, the jury “almost at once returned a verdict of wilful murder in each case against John Jones alias John Jenkins.” In addition to serving as the foreman of the Jury, the Reverend Charles Joyce also conducted the funeral services for the seven murdered members of the Emmanuel Marshall family. A refurbished gravestone is in the churchyard of St. Mary’s Church.. "

home to a couple of donkeys The Swan’s Garden is considered “almost a secret garden”. It is quite isolated and private and even includes a convenient patio area as well as a substantial wooded area. The Swan has one restricted table. It is reserved for John Payne, a beloved bell ringer from times past. Lifelong village resident Ann Collins explains: “Yes John Payne was a bellringer who died whilst in France and his body had to be brought back to Denham. The table at The Swan belonged to him and his wife Margaret. - a friend of mine when they lived in Baconsmead. When John died, Margaret sold her cottage to her neighbour who had visited The Swan with John for the occasional drink. She gave her neighbour the table, assuming he would use it as a work bench, then take it to the tip when he had finished with it. Unbeknownst to Margaret, he donated it to the Swan and had the brass plate fitted."" The owners in 2022 have described themselves as “protectors of the Swan, only to pass on the cultural history and enjoyment of this British Pub.” Little wonder then, that the customers and the staff are the best parts of their experiences at the Swan gastropub. …and that they have made the acquaintance of Sarah, their resident ghost. There is a special coziness to the Swan. Whether you are dressed for the theatre or stopping for a pint with your canine friend, there is a comfortable place for you at the Swan.

Green Man is quite a common name for a pub - though descriptions of its origins and the representations of the figure do vary,. Some historical references suggest that the original name comes from images in churches as a face peering through, or made of, leaves and petals. The current pictorial sign for the Green Man seems to support that idea. However, some previous signs of the Green Man in Denham, show a figure similar to Robin Hood dressed in green cloth or leaves, standing where the forest previously stood. Still another idea is that the Green Man takes its name from the person who used to take the letters as they came by road in the coaching days.

was certainly in the pub business by the mid 19th century when it was the centre of some village conflict ending up in the courts. The proliferation of drinking establishments in the village that later amazed Stanley Hoffman was definitely not to the liking of the lord of the manor Benjamin Way in 1842, though it seems he might have been better disposed if he had owned more than three of them himself. The owner of The Green Man until midsummer 1842 was an Uxbridge brewer, Thomas Fellowes. His tenant who carried on the business of a beerhouse was one William Flitney. Mr. Flitney's licence expired on ""Lady Day"" 25th March 1842 and he had to set about renewal. He had to demonstrate that the premises from which he conducted his business had a rateable value above the statutorily fixed amount of £8 per year. Mr. Sedgewick, a local surveyor, reported that the property easily passed the test. But Benjamin Way did not agree and refused to support the licence renewal application. Mr. Fellowes threatened to sue but thought better of taking on the lord of the manor and promptly rid himself of the problem by selling The Green Man to another local brewer George Harman. So it was left to Bill Flitney to fight it out for himself at what was known as the ""vestry"" meeting, the body we now think of as the parish council. As lord of the manor, Benjamin Way was of course a member of the ""vestry"" and many, if not all, the other members, the village dignitaries, were of course his close associates. It cannot have been a surprise to Bill Flitney that his licence application was refused. He sued. It was then the new owner, George Harman, came to Bill Flitney's aid as a supporting witness. George supplied The Green Man from his brewery in Uxbridge and he had purchased the property in the summer of 1842 together with the cottage next door as a business proposition. He was naturally none too pleased that the beerhouse should lose its licence. He had already tried a little persuasion when he met Benjamin Way one day at Uxbridge Market, but Way dismissed Harman telling him he was a fool to have spent his money, for The Green Man would never get its licence. George tried again a short while later by visiting Benjamin Way at home. When he was a second time refused, George demanded to be given a reason. He must have annoyed Mr. Way by his demand because, as George Harman later testified to the court, Way admitted that his opposition to the Green Man's licence was to protect the drinking establishments that he owned in the village. In 1842, unlike today disputes like this were decided by juries, but Mr. Justice Patteson had no doubt about how the jury should be directed. He hoped that the jury members would realise that what they had to decide was whether Benjamin Way was guilty of ""corrupt and malicious motive"" and he reminded the jury that such a verdict would cast ""imputations on the character of a gentleman who had a large property in the County, was in Her Majesty's Commission of the Peace, and had served in the office of High Sheriff of the County"". The jury members wisely protected their own interests by avoiding such a damaging finding against Benjamin Way but otherwise, and to the displeasure of the judge, appear to have found in favour of Mr. Flitney.

Directory of historical public houses, lists Edward Harbour as a beer retailer at The Green Man in 1895, with subsequent Harbour family relations as Beer House Keepers until 1921. At that time George Evans and Caroline Evans took over as the Beer Retailers. In 1992, the Harefield Gazette included an article about the Green Man describing it as ""a popular olde worlde pub in the middle of the picturesque village of Denham transformed into a homely refuge for the lovers of good food and drink"". Three years later the then licensees were thanking their regular customers for their forbearance while work was completed on an extension at the back of the pub. A headline in the Uxbridge and West Drayton Gazette then announced: ""Green Man Builds on Success and described the pub as a traditional country pub with a warm and welcoming atmosphere and really friendly staff. A selection of Cask Beers, hot, home-made food are available even on the Thursday and Sunday Quiz nights."" The 21st century has seen further building on the pub's reputation with the addition of features using new skills in management and design.

pubs that have been lost - The Plough - The most recent name of the pub on Cheapside Lane was The King, but it was known by many of the village's longer established residents by very different names. For several years prior to its acquiring the name of The King, the pub was known as The Fat Cow rumoured to have been in consequence of the mischievous humour of the licensee over which we will quickly pass. Originally it bore a name suited to its location in an old farming village - the Plough,  a common enough name for a pub in a farming village. One possible reason for the fact that Denham Village has had so many drinking establishments is that Uxbridge appears to have been home to several breweries eager to supply nearby retail outlets. In 1874 Uxbridge brewers T and J Nash Limited were thriving sufficiently to afford a significant enlargement to their premises. The completion of the works was considered a cause for a celebration. Close at hand was Mr. Russell a former employee of T and J Nash and by 1874 the landlord of The Plough. What better place then for celebrations to take place. In a delightfully written piece of Victorian journalism, under the heading ""Supper to Workmen"", the Buckinghamshire Advertiser reported the event in November 1874: The spread was, we need scarcely say, a most liberal one. T Nash Esq. presided and Mr. J. Holland occupied the vice-chair. After the party, numbering about 40, had done full justice to the meal, a number of toasts were proposed and responded to including of course their generous employers, Messrs. Nash, Mr. Holland, the brewer and Mr. Scarp, the bailiff.

pubs that have been lost - The Black Donkey -Stanley Hoffman's observation about the number of drinking establishments in the village was also a reflection on the house in which he was himself brought up, the house opposite the Green Man that he knew as The Homestead. We know it as Ashbys. It too, or at least part of the house, was once a drinking establishment called The Black Donkey. A report in the Uxbridge and West Drayton Gazette of Saturday, 30 July 1881 revealed that Edwin Allison, a 33 year old baker had applied for a licence ""to sell at retail at my house situated at Denham, beer to be consumed off the premises"". The house in question was at the corner of what was once Brook Street leading from Village Road down to the Misbourne Brook. This time, the Benjamin Way of 1842 having been succeeded by his son, the Way family had no objections. Edwin Allison's application included the notice that ""Benjamin Henry Walpole Way, Esq. of Denham Place, is the Owner of the said house, and the same is now in my occupation.” Mr. Way was also, it seems, happy to have his head coachman Mr. Garner give evidence to the licensing authority of Edwin Allison's good character. But all was not plain sailing for Edwin Allison. His application for a licence was at first adjourned by the local magistrates for further evidence to be taken as to whether Mr. Allison was a fit and proper person after it was revealed that four years earlier he had been found still drinking at The Swan after closing time. There were rumours too that Allison kept an unlicensed dog and that he was known to quarrel loudly with his wife. Such obstacles to the acquisition of a licence to trade in alcohol suggest a determination to confine such businesses to traders of the highest morality. Certainly Lewis Bampton over at The Swan was concerned for the reputation of local business as he opposed Mr. Allison's application - or perhaps his opposition was more motivated by desire to limit competition. Nonetheless the weight of evidence was in favour of Edwin Allison's good character. The magistrates included a barrister very familiar with the neighbourhood, Springall Thompson, once owner and occupier of Denham Cottage on the property that we know today as The White House. He and his fellow magistrates could find no reason to deny Mr. Allison his licence. It seems Edwin Allison did not stay long. By 1891 Stanley Hoffman's grandparents had taken the tenancy of the property they named The Homestead. Their landlords were Charles Harman & Co. the brewery once owned by George Harman who back in 1842 had so supported William Flitney.

pubs that have been lost - The Eight Bells - Little is known of the Eight Bells as a drinking establishment save for its name and the fame it has gained as the home of the artists Sir William Nicholson and Mabel Pryde and the birthplace of the painter of abstract compositions, landscape and still-life, Ben Nicholson. Had it not been for the Nicholsons it seems that the entry of the Eight Bells pub into Denham's village history would have long since been forgotten. In 1863 an advertisement appeared in the pages of the Uxbridge and West Drayton Gazette inviting ""Brewers and others"" to contact Mr. Woolls of Uxbridge for details of an available tenancy of the property, which was said, with a certain amount of geographical licence, to ""abut"" the intended line of the railway. Perhaps the then licensee of the Eight Bells hoped to benefit from rail traveller visitors to the village seeking refreshment but if so the venture had also a high level of optimism since no railway station was opened at Denham until 1906. It is not known who took up the offer of a tenancy, but the time of the Eight Bells as a pub seems to have been confined to a short period in the 1860s. According to the census of 1861, in the parish and village of Denham were 1,054 inhabitants. They were already well supplied with beverages. There is no record of a victualler or beer house keeper between The Swan and Hills House in 1861 and certainly Lewis Bampton at The Swan and William Flitney at The Green Man were untroubled by competition from the Eight Bells in 1871. As did many public houses close to churches the Eight Bells took its name from the peal of eight bells of St. Mary's Church but since the Nicholsons moved out back to London in 1896 their home has been known in the village as The White Cottage."
